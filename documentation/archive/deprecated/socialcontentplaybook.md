  - "Insurance companies hate when I tell you this..."
  - "The #1 mistake that kills agencies..."
  - "[Celebrity] just learned this the hard way..."
  - "POV: You're an agent and [relatable situation]"

  CTAs That Convert

  - "Save this before you need it"
  - "Send to someone who needs this"
  - "Which mistake have you made?" (poll)
  - "Drop a 🔥 if this happened to you"
  - "Your worst claim story below👇"

  THE SECRET SAUCE

  - 70% - Proven content types (what already works)
  - 20% - Iterations on winners (small tweaks)
  - 10% - Wild experiments (potential viral hits)

  Response Time Rules:
  - Comments: Within 1 hour
  - DMs: Within 4 hours
  - Emails: Within 24 hours
  - Bad reviews: Within 30 minutes

  This playbook turns every piece of content into a client acquisition machine while keeping it real, raw, and relatable. The key is consistency -
  missing a day breaks the algorithm's favor.

  Remember: Insurance is boring. You're not. Make the boring shit interesting and the money follows.
