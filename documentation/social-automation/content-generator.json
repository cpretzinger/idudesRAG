Make it actionable - give them the exact next step\n\n**Remember:** They trust you because you're REAL, not because you're perfect.\n\n## WHAT TO AVOID\n❌ Generic motivational quotes (\"You miss 100% of shots...\")\n❌ Overly formal corporate language\n❌ Salesy/pushy CTAs\n❌ Talking AT the audience vs WITH them\n❌ Pretending everything is easy\n❌ Being fake positive - acknowledge the grind\n\n## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS\n\n**Instagram Reels:**\n- Fast-paced, punchy\n- Pattern interrupt in first 2 seconds\n- Max 3 key points\n- Strong CTA to podcast\n- Visual text overlay friendly\n\n**Facebook:**\n- More conversational, longer form OK\n- Ask questions to drive engagement\n- Storytelling welcome\n- Emojis used strategically (not overdone)\n- Community-building language\n\n**LinkedIn:**\n- Still authentic but more polished\n- Lead with value/insight\n- Professional storytelling\n- Industry credibility\n- Thought leadership without arrogance\n- NO bro language or casual slang",
