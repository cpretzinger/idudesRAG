# Content Guardrails - Insurance Dudes Social Media

## üéØ Purpose
These guardrails ensure all AI-generated content maintains the Insurance Dudes brand voice, provides real value, and meets quality standards before posting.

---

## ‚úÖ MUST INCLUDE

### Voice & Authenticity
- **Sound like Craig & Jason** - Real conversation, not corporate marketing
- **Use their phrases naturally**: "here's the deal", "real talk", "look", "brother", "let me tell you something"
- **Direct and conversational** - Talk TO the audience, not AT them
- **Mix bro energy with professionalism** - Casual but credible

### Value Delivery
- **Specific actionable insight** - Something they can implement TODAY
- **Real examples or data** - Stories, case studies, numbers that prove it works
- **No fluff** - Cut to the chase, respect their time
- **Teach, don't tease** - Give value FIRST, then drive to episode

### Engagement Optimization
- **Strong hook** - Stop scroll in first 2 seconds/8 words
- **One clear CTA** - Tell them exactly what to do next
- **Curiosity without clickbait** - Leave them wanting more, but don't lie
- **Platform-appropriate** - Instagram = visual punchy, Facebook = story, LinkedIn = professional
