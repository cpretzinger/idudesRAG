## What to AVOID

‚ùå Generic motivational quotes ("You miss 100% of shots...")
‚ùå Overly formal corporate language
‚ùå Salesy/pushy CTAs
‚ùå Talking AT the audience vs WITH them
‚ùå Pretending everything is easy
‚ùå Being fake positive - acknowledge the grind

"Did you know that most agents give up on lead generation too early? üò≤"

### AFTER (Craig & Jason Style):
"Real talk - I see agents bail on internet leads after like 5 calls. That's not lead gen failing... that's YOU failing the lead. Let me show you the system that fixes this."
