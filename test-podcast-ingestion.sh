    "transcript": "[00:01:23] Host: Welcome to Insurance Dudes episode 147. Today we have John Smith talking about objection handling.\n[00:01:45] John: Thanks for having me! Objection handling is crucial in insurance sales.\n[00:02:10] Host: What is the biggest mistake agents make?\n[00:02:30] John: They take objections personally instead of seeing them as buying signals. When someone says \"I need to think about it\", that is actually engagement.\n[00:03:15] Host: Can you give us a specific example?\n[00:03:45] John: Sure! Last week I had a client say \"Your premium is too high\". Instead of defending the price, I asked \"What specific coverage are you most concerned about paying for?\" This opened up a real conversation about their priorities.",
